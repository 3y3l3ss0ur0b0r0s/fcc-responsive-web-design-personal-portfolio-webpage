          I am still working on the freeCodeCamp curriculum, so this page is still in progress (though this is a slow process!). I first started in March 2022. I took a long break, and finally resumed in November 2022 as part of my preparation to continue my BSCS degree after years of being out of the program.
          <br><br>
          I am doing my best to focus on learning rather than being a perfectionist. I hope you enjoy watching my journey!
